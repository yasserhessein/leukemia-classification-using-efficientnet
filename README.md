### Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common type of childhood cancer and accounts for approximately 25% of the pediatric cancers.

These cells have been segmented from microscopic images and are representative of images in the real-world because they contain some staining noise and illumination errors, although these errors have largely been fixed in the course of acquisition.

The task of identifying immature leukemic blasts from normal cells under the microscope is challenging due to morphological similarity and thus the ground truth labels were annotated by an expert oncologist.





# *EfficientNet* 

EfficientNet is a convolutional neural network architecture and scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a compound coefficient. Unlike conventional practice that arbitrary scales these factors, the EfficientNet scaling method uniformly scales network width, depth, and resolution with a set of fixed scaling coefficients.
